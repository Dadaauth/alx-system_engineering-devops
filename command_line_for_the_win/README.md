steps followed when using sftp to upload image files:
I went ahead to type sftp then my username and the server ip address
I asked for my password and i gave it to it
after getting in, I navigated to the required directory and used the put command to upload the files like below:
put C:/Users/dadaa/Pictures/Screenshots/*.png
That is all...
